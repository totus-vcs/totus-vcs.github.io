                            With the e-commerce industry significantly expanding, and the huge reliance on trucks for transport of 
                            goods in Australia, the logistics company is under more pressure than ever before. 
                            The COVID-19 pandemic has put even more strain on the industry - now there are less truck drivers, and more truck drivers
                            wanting to spend time at home with their family.

                            The TOTUS project aims to fix this - by enabling the remote operation of
                            trucks, vehicles and industrial systems.

                            We are developing an innovative solution, an easy to install mechanism on exsiting trucks
                            with remote control acceleration and steering, as well as a range of sensors and safety features, to give
                            the logistics industry a reliable solution, and give drivers an optimal experience in remote control driving.
